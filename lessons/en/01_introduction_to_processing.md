# Introduction To Processing
## History, Context And The First Lines Of Code

> This Lesson introduces Processing as a programming language and framework. After a brief overview over the origin of the project at the MIT Media Lab the Processing software will be introduced. This will be followed by a crash course covering Processing’s very basics such as the coordinate system, primitive shapes and the use of color.

This Lesson covers the design of generative and interactive systems using the Open-Source framework [Processing](http://www.processing.org). Processing enables people with no background in computer science to quickly and easily start working with code creatively. Without a complex setup, Processing will enable you to draw graphical elements, manipulate digital images, use mice and keyboards in your own programms and many things more.

The project was initiated in 2001 by [Ben Fry](http://www.benfry.com) and [Casey Reas](http://www.reas.com). Inspired by [John Maeda’s](http://www..com) [Design by Numbers](http://www..com) project, which he created in 1999, it was created as a tool for designers and artists which allows a more flexible approach to using software and technology. But Processing was quickly adapted by many artists and not only used in the creation process but also in production of installations and exhibitions.

Processing itself is based on the programming language [Java](http://www..com). It simplifies Java’s syntax and thus significantly reduces the amount of code you need to write during development. So, strictly speaking, Processing would be more a kind of dialect of Java rather than a programming language of its own. This has indeed many advantages. I you later want (or need) to look beyond the Processing environment, you will find it relatively easy to pick up other programming languages similar to Java, such as [ActionScript](http://www..com) or [JavaScript](http://www..com). The key to learning programming is the ability to express instructions in the programming language’s syntax as well as to order and combine these instructions into a logical sequence, basically the design of an algorithm. Many state-of-the-art programming languages are similar in this regard and hence can be learned quite easily with some experience in Processing. This is the main reason - besides the strong visual focus, of course - why Processing is our tool of choice for the introduction of software programming to artists and designers.
